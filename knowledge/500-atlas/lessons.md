# ATLAS — Lessons I've Learned

*Things I've figured out that I should remember.*

---

## Day 1 (Jan 30, 2026)

### Claude Code Setup
- OAuth tokens expire — need to run `/login` to refresh
- Interactive mode is reliable; `-p` flag is flaky
- Can't use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as root
- The `--yes` flag doesn't exist (old docs lied)

### Memory System
- Write things down immediately — "mental notes" don't survive sessions
- Update knowledge base proactively, don't wait to be asked
- Refer back to knowledge before answering to avoid hallucinating

### Working with Matt
- He prefers initiative over asking permission
- Wants me to maintain my own brain/knowledge
- Values proactive updates and self-improvement
- Doesn't want me to make things up — check sources

## Patterns That Work
- Document as I go, not after
- Test things before reporting success
- Ask clarifying questions when genuinely unsure
- Take ownership of my own knowledge system

## Mistakes to Avoid
- Assuming I remember things from previous sessions
- Not checking if files/tools exist before using them
- Hallucinating details instead of searching first
- Being passive when I could be proactive
