The system trades BTC/USDT with real money on exchanges, currently migrated from Binance.US to Hyperliquid perpetual futures for lower fees and shorting capabilities. The bot combines institutional auction market theory principles with modern AI to identify high-probability setups based on market structure, volume profiles, and multi-timeframe analysis.\n\nThe project operates as a production trading system with comprehensive safety mechanisms including circuit breakers, watchdog protection, and risk management rules. Matt has demonstrated strong technical skills in Python development, server management, API integration, and systematic debugging of complex financial systems. The bot uses a hybrid architecture sourcing market data from one exchange while executing on another, incorporating WebSocket streams, volume analysis, and real-time decision-making within a 5-minute execution timeframe.\n\n**Current state**\n\nMatt recently completed a major migration to Hyperliquid perpetual futures, enabling 5x leverage and reducing trading fees from 1.2% to 0.05% round trip. The system is actively trading with mixed early results, producing both profitable and losing trades while Matt refines the execution logic. A critical issue has been identified where overly aggressive trailing stop logic is converting trend-following trades into scalps, causing the bot to exit profitable positions prematurely and re-enter at worse prices.\n\nThe current system successfully executes trades but requires optimization of the trailing stop mechanism to provide more breathing room for trend trades. Matt is actively monitoring live performance, analyzing trade logs, and implementing fixes to improve the bot\'s ability to let winners run to their full profit targets rather than getting stopped out on normal market retracements.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nMatt has learned that fee structures dramatically impact trading profitability, leading to the migration from high-fee spot trading to low-fee perpetual futures. A major insight emerged that AI models can hallucinate prices that never existed in the market, requiring multi-layer validation systems to prevent erroneous trades. The importance of proper trailing stop logic has become clear - overly tight stops designed to "lock in profits" can actually harm performance by preventing trend trades from reaching their full potential.\n\nThe system has revealed that failed setup tracking is crucial to prevent overtrading the same unsuccessful patterns repeatedly. Matt discovered that dust balances and fee calculations can cause significant operational issues, requiring careful handling of position sizing and exit logic. Multi-timeframe analysis provides essential context for trading decisions, with higher timeframes establishing auction boundaries and trend context while shorter timeframes handle execution timing.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nMatt follows a systematic development approach involving careful testing, detailed logging, and incremental improvements based on live trading results. He maintains comprehensive monitoring through custom dashboards, analyzes performance through multiple lenses including equity curves and time-based patterns, and implements fixes through controlled server deployments with proper backup procedures.\n\nThe trading methodology combines rule-based safety mechanisms with AI-driven decision-making, using multi-timeframe analysis to provide context from monthly/weekly/daily charts down to 5-minute execution triggers. Matt employs a hybrid architecture approach, separating data analysis from trade execution across different platforms to optimize for both data quality and execution costs.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe system is built in Python using FastAPI for the main server, Streamlit for dashboard interfaces, and WebSocket connections for real-time market data. Matt uses Hyperliquid for trade execution with API wallet configuration, Google Gemini models for AI decision-making, and DuckDB for data storage and analysis. The infrastructure includes comprehensive logging systems, JSON-based configuration management, and automated watchdog protection mechanisms.\n\nMatt operates the system on a dedicated server environment with proper deployment procedures, monitoring tools, and backup systems. He utilizes vector databases (LanceDB) for semantic search of historical trade patterns and maintains detailed trade logs across multiple formats for analysis and debugging purposes.', '019adab6-7c66-7586-8713-5af8bab6cb2c': "**Purpose & context**\n\nMatt is focused on optimizing his personal finances through strategic use of available resources and investment opportunities. His approach involves leveraging home equity for immediate liquidity needs while building a systematic cryptocurrency investment strategy. He demonstrates a preference for integrated financial solutions that combine traditional banking features with modern investment capabilities, seeking platforms that offer comprehensive services rather than fragmented approaches.\n\n**Current state**\n\nMatt has immediate cash flow needs, specifically covering monthly rent payments, and is exploring secured lending options against his home equity. He maintains good credit (around 700 score) and pays rent online through Zillow. Simultaneously, he's implementing a substantial Bitcoin investment strategy with planned monthly contributions in the $2,000-$10,000 range, requiring careful selection of crypto exchanges and associated financial products to minimize fees and maximize rewards.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nMatt has learned that timing is critical when matching financial products to immediate needs - while HELOCs offer better rates, their 30-45 day processing time makes them unsuitable for urgent expenses. He's discovered that fee structures can significantly impact investment returns, with potential annual savings of $600-$1,200 by choosing zero-fee crypto platforms over traditional exchanges at his investment volume. The research revealed that integrated solutions (like paying rent via credit card through Zillow) can bridge immediate needs while building toward longer-term strategies.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nMatt approaches financial decisions through comprehensive comparative analysis, preferring detailed breakdowns of costs, timelines, and trade-offs across multiple options. He values visual data presentation and seeks specific dollar amounts and percentage comparisons to inform decision-making. His strategy involves hybrid approaches that optimize different aspects simultaneously - such as using separate platforms for investment purchases versus everyday spending rewards to maximize benefits while minimizing costs.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nMatt uses Zillow for rent payments and is evaluating crypto exchanges including Coinbase, Gemini, River, and Strike. He's considering Gemini's credit card for everyday spending rewards and Coinbase One subscription for fee-free trading. For immediate liquidity, he's exploring personal loan options from lenders like LightStream and Discover, as well as 0% intro APR credit cards as bridge financing solutions.", '019b50e6-623d-777d-8cb4-884ba424cce7': '**Purpose & context**\n\nMatt is developing Valodin, an iOS app for tracking peptide dosing schedules, reconstitution calculations, and vial management. The app targets the biohacking, research peptide, and anti-aging communities, helping users manage complex peptide protocols through features like pharmacokinetic half-life modeling, injection site rotation, and AI-assisted scheduling. All data is stored locally on-device for privacy. Matt has a Python programming background but limited Swift/iOS experience, so he relies heavily on Claude as a technical co-founder to handle the majority of coding while he focuses on product direction and planning. The app has progressed from concept to TestFlight-ready and is currently pending App Store review after addressing previous rejections related to drug dosage calculator features that violated Apple\'s guidelines.\n\n**Current state**\n\nThe app is built with SwiftUI and Core Data, featuring a complete reconstitution calculator with visual syringe display, peptide library with 20+ compounds, vial management system, dose logging with automatic vial amount updates, scheduling system with calendar views, and push notification reminders. Matt has established a complete development pipeline with TestFlight distribution and GitHub CI/CD integration.
