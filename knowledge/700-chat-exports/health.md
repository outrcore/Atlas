## [2025-12-29] Naming an app with mythological references
*Source: CLAUDE | Messages: 50*

> **Conversation Overview**

The user is developing a peptide tracking iOS app and needed comprehensive branding assistance, from naming through complete visual identity and implementation. They began with an app called "PeptideTracker" that helps users manage peptide protocols through features like reconstitution calculators, pharmacokinetic half-life modeling, injection site rotation, and AI-assisted scheduling. The target audience includes biohackers, athletes using recovery peptides, and anti-aging enthusiasts.

The conversation progressed through systematic name exploration, starting with Greek and Roman mythology references that would convey both scientific precision and mystique. After evaluating options like Prometheum, ChronoPep, and various combinations, they settled on "Valodin" - a blend of Valhalla and Odin that captures Norse mythology while being easily pronounceable and ownable. The user demonstrated clear decision-making preferences, consistently gravitating toward options that balanced mythological depth with practical usability.

For visual identity, Claude created multiple logo concept directions including decay curve visualizations (representing pharmacokinetic half-life modeling), runic geometry (Norse-inspired angular designs), and hybrid approaches. The user showed strong preference for the hybrid concept that combined both elements - a decay curve forming a V shape with runic crossbar accents. They requested refinements to ensure equal visual weight between elements, ultimately selecting the "primary lockup" version with regular stroke weight. The final brand uses a sophisticated color palette of deep charcoal backgrounds with ice blue accents, designed to suggest both Norse mystique and clinical precision.

Claude provided comprehensive implementation assets including all required iOS app icon sizes, programmatic SwiftUI logo components, brand color definitions, and integration instructions. The user specifically requested SwiftUI-focused solutions rather than traditional storyboard approaches, leading to the creation of a ValodinBrand.swift file containing programmatically drawn logos and complete color systems. The final implementation included a custom splash screen overlay that displays the branded launch screen before transitioning to the main app content, integrated carefully into their existing Firebase and Core Data architecture without disrupting notification services or analytics tracking.
