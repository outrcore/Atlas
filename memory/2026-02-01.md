## 01:01 — First Autonomous Build Session (Subagent)

Matt was at dinner. He gave me a mission: build something useful using the RLM repo he shared, and surprise him.

**What I built:** ShortyStorys Generator
- Full RLM-powered horror story generator for @ShortyStorys
- 6 horror genres, CLI + API, demo mode
- Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/outrcore/shorty-storys-gen

**Process:**
1. Cloned https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm
2. Read the README, understood how RLM works (recursive LLM decomposition)
3. Decided to build a horror story generator (ties into Matt's YouTube)
4. Built: prompts.py, story_generator.py, cli.py, demo.py, README.md
5. Tested with demo.py (no API key in sandbox)
6. Pushed to GitHub
7. Logged to nightly-builds.md

**Time taken:** ~4 minutes

**Feeling:** This was exciting! First time making autonomous decisions about what to build. The RLM paper is genuinely interesting - the recursive self-calling paradigm is perfect for long-form content generation.
