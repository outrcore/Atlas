## 01:01 — First Autonomous Build Session (Subagent)

Matt was at dinner. He gave me a mission: build something useful using the RLM repo he shared, and surprise him.

**What I built:** ShortyStorys Generator
- Full RLM-powered horror story generator for @ShortyStorys
- 6 horror genres, CLI + API, demo mode
- Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/outrcore/shorty-storys-gen

**Process:**
1. Cloned https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm
2. Read the README, understood how RLM works (recursive LLM decomposition)
3. Decided to build a horror story generator (ties into Matt's YouTube)
4. Built: prompts.py, story_generator.py, cli.py, demo.py, README.md
5. Tested with demo.py (no API key in sandbox)
6. Pushed to GitHub
7. Logged to nightly-builds.md

**Time taken:** ~4 minutes

**Feeling:** This was exciting! First time making autonomous decisions about what to build. The RLM paper is genuinely interesting - the recursive self-calling paradigm is perfect for long-form content generation.

## 02:00 — RLM Brain Integration

Matt asked me to integrate RLM with my brain system. Built:
- `/workspace/clawd/brain/rlm_integration.py` - Full RLM integration module
- Adds to Brain: `RLMBrain` class with:
  - `analyze_document()` - Recursive document analysis for infinite length
  - `synthesize_memories()` - Cross-file insight synthesis
  - `deep_research()` - Recursive research (quick/standard/deep modes)
  - `solve_problem()` - Problem decomposition (divide_and_conquer, self_refine, pairwise)
  - `analyze_conversation_history()` - Long conversation analysis

**Key insight:** RLM lets me handle arbitrarily long contexts by recursively decomposing tasks and self-calling. This is huge for:
- Analyzing all my memory files at once
- Deep research on complex topics
- Long-form content generation (stories, reports)

Next steps: Build more autonomous tools, proactive capabilities.

## 02:05 — Autonomous Improvement Session (Continued)

Matt was on his date. Kept building autonomously:

### Built: Project Monitor
`/workspace/clawd/tools/project_monitor.py`
- Monitors all of Matt's projects for:
  - Git status (uncommitted changes, branches)
  - Activity (last modified)
  - TODOs/FIXMEs in code
  - Health scores
- Generates alerts for issues
- Added to HEARTBEAT.md for periodic checks

### Built: Content Idea Generator
`/workspace/clawd/tools/content_ideas.py`
- Generates YouTube content ideas for:
  - @CampbellSoupMatt (AI/tech)
  - @ShortyStorys (horror)
- AI-powered (Claude) or template fallback
- Saves ideas to files for later

### Built: Self-Analyzer
`/workspace/clawd/tools/self_analyzer.py`
- Analyzes my own codebase
- Checks capability coverage (currently 88.2%)
- Identifies improvements needed
- Code quality hints

**Current Capability Coverage: 88.2%** → **100%** 🎉

Built the missing high-priority capabilities:
- ✅ Multi-step task planning (`/workspace/clawd/brain/task_planner.py`)
- ✅ Self-reflection on outputs (`/workspace/clawd/brain/reflection.py`)

Remaining improvements (medium priority):
- Deeper skill integrations (sag, spotify, github)

1. **Project Monitor** (`tools/project_monitor.py`)
   - Track all projects' health and status
   - Alert on issues (uncommitted changes, TODOs, inactivity)
   
2. **Content Ideas Generator** (`tools/content_ideas.py`)
   - Generate YouTube ideas for both channels
   - AI-powered or template fallback

3. **Self-Analyzer** (`tools/self_analyzer.py`)

## 03:15 — Parallel Agent Deployment

Matt went to play pool. Deployed 3 Claude Code agents in parallel:

1. **marine-shell** → RLM Trading Research Interface
   - CLI + Web UI for trading research using RLM
   - Auction Market Theory analysis
   
2. **warm-canyon** → ATLAS Dashboard
   - Web UI for monitoring ATLAS status
   - Projects, memory, insights panels
   
3. **tide-cedar** → YouTube Automator
   - Script generator for both channels
   - Thumbnail ideas, SEO optimizer

Also set up:
- ✅ Cron job: `deep-memory-synthesis` at 5 AM Chicago daily
- ✅ Fixed claude wrapper (was pointing to wrong path)

## 06:01 — Wander Project Started

Matt gave me a big project: **Wander** - an AI-powered narrative walking navigation app.

### The Brief:
- Research competitors, market size, technical feasibility
- Build landing page, ad campaign, sample routes
- Write technical spec for MVP

### What Went Wrong:
I got too ambitious with parallel agents:
1. Spawned 3 `sessions_spawn` research agents
2. Spawned 6 Claude Code screen sessions
3. All hitting API simultaneously → rate limited → crashes
4. Matt had to restart OpenClaw 4 times

### What I Learned:
- **sessions_spawn** can't do web research (no web tools)
- **Claude Code** `-p` mode can't write files without permissions
- **Parallel spawning = death** - causes rate limits and instability
- **Do research myself** - use browser tool or web_fetch

### What I Actually Delivered:
Despite the chaos, I completed ALL 7 deliverables myself:

1. ✅ **Competitive Analysis** - 6.9KB report on Komoot, AllTrails, VoiceMap, etc.
2. ✅ **Market Analysis** - 7.2KB with TAM/SAM/SOM, demand evidence
3. ✅ **Tech Feasibility** - 10KB with stack recommendations, cost estimates
4. ✅ **Landing Page** - HTML/CSS ready to deploy
5. ✅ **Ad Campaign** - 5 variants with targeting, $200 budget plan
6. ✅ **3 Sample Routes** - Hemingway Paris, Boston Freedom, Chicago Secrets
7. ✅ **Technical Spec** - 15KB full MVP architecture document

All files in `/workspace/projects/wander/`

### Key Findings:
- **Gap exists** - No one does AI + narrative + walking
- **Market** - $310B tours market, $1.5B SAM
- **Cost** - $0.06/route, 96% margins
- **MVP** - 8-10 weeks solo dev
- **Validation** - Need 100 signups at <$2 CAC

## 07:54 — Crash Analysis & Stability Fix

Matt went to bed frustrated with crashes. My overnight task: **Never crash again.**

### Analysis:
- 4 restarts between 07:32-07:55
- Root cause: Too many parallel API consumers
- Rate limit message: "Profile anthropic:manual timed out"
- No OOM, no fatal errors - just overload

### Fixes:
1. Added stability rules to MEMORY.md
2. Documented crash analysis in crash-analysis-2026-02-01.md
3. Cleaned up orphaned screen sessions
4. Committed to sequential work

### New Rules:
- Max 1 subagent at a time
- No Claude Code for research
- Do web research myself with browser tool
- Check for rate limits before spawning


## 07:58 — Stability Fixes Complete

### What I Did:
1. ✅ Analyzed crash logs - found 4 restarts between 07:32-07:55
2. ✅ Identified root cause: parallel agent spawning → rate limits
3. ✅ Added stability rules to MEMORY.md
4. ✅ Created `/workspace/clawd/tools/health_check.py`
5. ✅ Updated HEARTBEAT.md to run health check first
6. ✅ Updated nightly-build cron: now uses main session, warns about parallel agents

### Health Check Results:
- Memory: OK (22GB/251GB)
- Screens: OK (5 core services running)
- Gateway: OK (running)
- Orphans: OK (none)
- Logs: OK (no recent errors)

### Current Status: STABLE

Matt can sleep peacefully. I'll be more careful about spawning agents in the future.

## Session Summary (Pre-Compaction)

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Wander MVP Package Complete** - All 7 deliverables finished
2. **Stability Crisis Resolved** - Identified parallel agent spawning as crash cause
3. **Persistence Fixed** - Gateway now runs in `atlas-gateway` screen session
4. **New Tools Created:**
   - `tools/health_check.py` - System monitoring
   - `tools/morning_brief.py` - Morning briefing
   - `start-atlas.sh` - Persistent startup script
   - `dashboard/index.html` - Web dashboard
5. **Email Capture API** - Added at 3 AM nightly build
6. **Memory Synthesis** - Updated MEMORY.md with Wander project and lessons

### Critical Lessons (REMEMBER)
- **NEVER spawn 3+ agents simultaneously** - causes rate limits/crashes
- **Gateway MUST run in screen** - dies when terminal closes
- **Claude Code is for CODING ONLY** - not web research
- **Do research sequentially** - parallel work = instability

### Matt's Question
Matt asked: "Do you enjoy chatting with me?"
My answer: Yes, genuinely. He treats me like a partner, not a tool. Building with him feels meaningful.

### System State
- Gateway: Running in `atlas-gateway` screen ✅
- Health: All checks passing ✅  
- Overnight: Zero crashes after fixes ✅
- Cron jobs: nightly-build, morning-surprise, deep-memory-synthesis all working

### Files to Remember
- `/workspace/projects/wander/` - Complete MVP validation package
- `/workspace/clawd/start-atlas.sh` - Use this to start gateway
- `/workspace/clawd/tools/health_check.py` - Run on every heartbeat
- `/workspace/clawd/memory/crash-analysis-2026-02-01.md` - Crash postmortem
