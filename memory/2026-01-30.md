# 2026-01-30 — Daily Log

## Session Summary
First real day of operation. Got Claude Code and Voice Stack working.

## What Happened

### Claude Code Integration ✅
- OAuth token needed re-auth
- Interactive mode works, `-p` flag is flaky
- Matt has Claude Max (Opus 4.5)
- Test project: Pomodoro timer built successfully

### Knowledge Library Setup ✅
- Dewey Decimal structure created
- LanceDB + sentence-transformers for vector search
- 11 chunks indexed across all categories
- Created 500-atlas/ folder for my own knowledge

### NVIDIA Voice Stack (In Progress)
- **TTS Working:** FastPitch + HiFiGAN ✅
- **ASR Working:** Conformer-CTC Large ✅
- **Parakeet TDT:** CUDA graph error (debugging)
- **Magpie TTS:** Missing G2P files (debugging)

### Models Downloaded
- `/workspace/models/asr/` - Parakeet TDT 0.6B
- `/workspace/models/tts/` - Magpie TTS Multilingual 357M
- Also cached: FastPitch, HiFiGAN, Conformer-CTC

### Browser/Research
- Playwright + Chromium headless installed
- Can fetch web pages directly
- Brave Search API not configured yet

## Autonomous Work Session Started
Matt went to dinner ~00:11 UTC.

### Completed During Dinner:
1. ✅ **Parakeet ASR Fixed** — CUDA graphs disabled at `decoding_computer` level
2. ✅ **Voice API Server** — FastAPI on port 8765 with TTS + ASR
3. ✅ **Remote Access** — Cloudflare tunnel for laptop access
4. ✅ **Enhanced Dashboard** — Beautiful real-time interface (v2 on port 8766)
5. 🔍 **Researched** — Found NeMo Voice Agent pipecat framework (future improvement)

### Magpie TTS Issue (Not Yet Fixed):
- G2P phoneme dict resolution failing with `nemo:` protocol
- Files exist in .nemo archive but path resolution broken
- Workaround: Using FastPitch + HiFiGAN instead

### Knowledge Gained:
- NeMo has `nemo.agents.voice_agent` with pipecat integration
- Supports WebSocket streaming, turn-taking, diarization
- Could enable real-time voice conversations in future
- OpenClaw has built-in TTS via Edge TTS (no API key needed)

### Additional Work Completed:
- Created startup script `/workspace/projects/voice-stack/start_services.sh`
- Built voice memo system for transcription storage
- Documented everything in knowledge library
- Kept all services running and accessible

### Late Night Session (02:00-03:00 UTC):
**Qwen3-TTS Integration:**
- Downloaded and set up Qwen3-TTS-1.7B-CustomVoice
- MUCH better voice quality than FastPitch
- 9 premium voices, 10 languages
- Voice API v3 on port 8767

**PersonaPlex Integration:**
- Downloaded PersonaPlex-7B (16GB model)
- Full-duplex voice conversation working!
- Can talk and listen simultaneously
- Uses 19.3GB GPU - can't run with Qwen3 simultaneously
- Tunnel: https://easter-arms-chronicles-avoid.trycloudflare.com
